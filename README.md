DCIT 23 - Lab Activities and Exams

Hello Everyone! I'm Kirk Erpil Yraola from BSCS 1-A. This repository includes all my lab activities, midterm project, and final project for the subject DCIT 23 (Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming). Each task helped build my skills in Java, from basic input/output to creating full GUI applications.

Lab 1
A basic console application that takes employee information such as name, age, total hours worked, and rate per hour. It computes and displays the employee’s daily wage.


Lab 2
Expanded the previous lab to include weekly, monthly, and annual wage computations. It also calculates how many years are left until retirement, and formats the name into a more formal style.


Lab 3
Added input validation for age and working hours, used switch-case statements to assign job roles, and introduced tax computation based on income brackets. The program now outputs a complete employee profile.


Lab 4
Introduced Java AWT to create a GUI version of the employee information system. It features input forms, error checking, and displays results in a scrollable text area.


Lab 5
Developed a simple multiple-choice quiz application using Java AWT. It tracks the user’s score, blocks changes after submission, and reminds users to select an answer before moving to the next question.


Lab 6
Created a To-Do List manager using Java Swing. It allows users to add tasks with a title, description, and status. Tasks are displayed in a JTable, and required fields must be filled out before adding.


MIDTERMS 
A console-based IT Support Ticket System. Users can submit tickets with urgency levels, update ticket status, view all tickets, and generate a summary report showing active and resolved tickets.


FINAL LAB PROJECT
Designed a basic calculator app using Java Swing. It handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It includes a reset button and manages errors like division by zero gracefully.
